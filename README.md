# HRnet
## Presentation
HRnet is an internal web application developed for Wealth Health society for managing employee lists. This new version, built with React, is designed to address various bugs present in the older jQuery-based version.


## Objectives
- Migrate the entire HRnet project to React with a new design.
- Perform Lighthouse performance tests to compare the old and new applications.

## Prerequisites 
- [Node JS version 20.13.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current)
- [React v18.3.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [Vite v5.3.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite/v/5.3.4)

Additionally, the project uses libraries such as Material-UI (MUI) and React Datepicker. I have also created and imported a custom library, [KDuong-select-lib](#), and invite you to test and contribute to its development.

1. Fork this repository: [hrnet-react-v2](https://github.com/K-Duong/hrnet-react-v2.git)
